      PRESIDENTIAL IN INTIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC)
      is a privately funded not- for-profit educational initiative started by
      President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help
      promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech
      fields like
    </p>

      <li><a href="#">Cloud Native Computing</a></li>
      <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
      <li>Block Chain</li>
      <li>IOT</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><span>C</span>loud Native computing:</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>Cloud Native Computing </b>program prepares the students to program
      in open source technologies like,<b>
        Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native
      </b>
      while introducing the students to development of Microservices and
      software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>

    <h1><span>A</span>rtifical Intelligence:</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>artificial intelligence program </b> of PIAIC takes the student
      through the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in
      open source languages like
      <b>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask, </b>and teaching
      deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life
      examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>

    <h1><span>B</span>lock Chain</h1>
    <p>
      The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain program </b>is to understand the
      blockchains like <b>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric), </b> and learn to
      program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like
      Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed
      Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth
      understanding of Blockchain-as-a- service (BaaS) and how to develop and
      offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>

    <h1><span>I</span>nternet of Things (IOT)</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>Internet of things program </b>introduces the students to open
      source development technologies like
      <b
        >Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and
        Kubernetes </b
      >while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge,
      IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
